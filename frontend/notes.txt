<------- general ------->
- graphQl vs RestFul
    A REST API is an architectural concept for network-based software. 
    GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language, a specification, 
    and a set of tools that operates over a single endpoint using HTTP. 
    In addition, over the last few years, REST has been used to make new APIs, 
    while the focus of GraphQL has been to optimize for performance and flexibility.
- React components has a built-in state object.
    The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
    When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
- CSSTransition is special component from 'react-transition-group' used to add transition effects

<------- syntatical ------->
- Map function have ()=>() instead of curly braces in react. 
- React lets you define components as classes or functions. 
    Components defined as classes currently provide more features 
    which are described in detail on this page.
- Switch is the component which will help to route to single matching exact route
    thus discarding the naive behaviour of Router
- React.Fragment is use to return more than 1 root based tags.
    eg. <1st></1st><2nd></2nd>
- create Portal allow to render independently of the root element.
    return ReactDom.createPortal(content, document.getElementById('drawer-hook'));
- ...props is spread operator which takes props object and make key value pair attributes
- "useRef()" provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.
  useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument 
  ( initialValue ). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. 
  Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its .current property.
- "onBlur()" is event handler triggered when cursor click in event area and then click outside the event area
- to avoid infinite loop between the useEffect and call back function use "useCallback()"
  also to avoid re-rendering of the same element when the state changes and instead replace with the callback.
- ...state means we first took copy of state.
- Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
  Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult
- formData is inbuilt JS(browser) api to formData

<------- architectural style ------->
- Presentational component such as Card
  statefull component such as some component which manages some states or is react to some states.
- props.children will render those componenttags which are in between the parent component or where the component is called.

<------- intuitive/other ------->
- The SFC (short for stateless functional component) defines a function type that returns a JSX Element
- stateful vs stateless

- when we have 2 interactive statesHook to maintain use 'useReducer'
- CORS: cross origin resource origin
