<------- general ------->
- graphQl vs RestFul
    A REST API is an architectural concept for network-based software. 
    GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language, a specification, 
    and a set of tools that operates over a single endpoint using HTTP. 
    In addition, over the last few years, REST has been used to make new APIs, 
    while the focus of GraphQL has been to optimize for performance and flexibility.
- React components has a built-in state object.
    The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
    When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
- CSSTransition is special component from 'react-transition-group' used to add transition effects

<------- syntatical ------->
- React lets you define components as classes or functions. 
    Components defined as classes currently provide more features 
    which are described in detail on this page.
- Switch is the component which will help to route to single matching exact route
    thus discarding the naive behaviour of Router
- React.Fragment is use to return more than 1 root based tags.
    eg. <1st></1st><2nd></2nd>
- create Portal allow to render independently of the root element.
    return ReactDom.createPortal(content, document.getElementById('drawer-hook'));

<------- architectural style ------->
- Presentational component such as Card
  statefull component such as some component which manages some states or is react to some states.
