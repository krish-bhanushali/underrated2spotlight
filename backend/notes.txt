<------- general ------->
- router means nothing but the way to listen certain http method 
- collections are tables in SQL db.
- The HTTP status code 500 is a generic error response. 
  It means that the server encountered an unexpected condition that 
  prevented it from fulfilling the request. This error is usually returned 
  by the server when no other error code is suitable.

<------- syntatical ------->
- encodeURIComponent() is used to take string and pass the urlFormatted string for api.

<------- intuitive/other ------->
- when we are implementing async func. never use throw
  TLDR: A function is hard to use when it sometimes returns a promise 
  and sometimes throws an exception. When writing an async function, 
  prefer to signal failure by returning a rejected promise.
- res.json({ place: place.toObject({ getters: true }) });
  here we want to convert to JS object and with not _id(name provided by mongoDB) but id

<------- libs ------->
- uuid: generate unique id
- express-validator: validator to check inputs
- axios is used to send request from one server to another.
